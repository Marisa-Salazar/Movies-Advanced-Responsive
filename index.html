          <p>
            Founded in Oregon in 2005 by President & CEO Travis Knight, LAIKA
            creates films that are born in imagination, shaped into stories, and
            crafted by passionate artists who give life to unforgettable
            characters. LAIKA' s five films: Coraline, ParaNorman, The
            Boxtrolls, Kubo and the Two Strings, and Missing Link were all
            nominated for the Academy AwardÂ® for Outstanding Animated Feature.
          </p>
          <p>
            At LAIKA, they are committed to telling original, enduring stories
            and bringing these tales to the widest possible audience while being
            a leader in filmmaking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Easily the most terrifying of LAIKA's films to date, Coraline also
            remains the studio's most financially successful. That's thanks to
            Gaiman's story about a little girl who discovers a parallel world to
            her own in which the inhabitants are an ideal version of her
            friends, family, and neighbors in her own world, despite the fact
            that their eyes have been replaced by buttons.

          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Hi, my name is Marisa and I am from New Mexico. I am currently a
            student in SheCodes as a Front-end developer junior. This project
            was special to me because I have grown to love horror themed
            animation. Thank you for taking the time to learn more.
